# Nmap Basic Port Scans - Connect, SYN, and UDP

Port scanning is how you find the services running on a host. This room covers the
three basic nmap scans and, more usefully, why each one works the way it does.

## The three scans

**TCP Connect scan (`-sT`)** completes the full three-way handshake: SYN, SYN/ACK,
ACK. If the handshake finishes, the port is open. It needs no special privileges, so
it is the fallback when you are not root. The downside is that finishing the handshake
means the connection is logged by the service.

**TCP SYN scan (`-sS`)** is the common default. It sends a SYN, waits for the SYN/ACK
that signals an open port, then sends a RST to tear the connection down before it
completes. Because the handshake never finishes, it is faster and quieter than a
connect scan. It needs root because it crafts raw packets.

**UDP scan (`-sU`)** covers the services TCP scans miss, like DNS, SNMP, and DHCP. UDP
has no handshake, so nmap infers state from what comes back or does not. It is slow,
but skipping it means missing a whole class of services.

## Port states

A port is not just open or closed. Nmap reports six states, and the extra ones come
from firewalls sitting in the path. **Open** means a service is listening. **Closed**
means nothing is listening but the port is reachable. **Filtered** means a firewall is
blocking nmap from telling either way. The rest are combinations nmap cannot fully
resolve. As a pentester, **open** is the state you care about, because it means a live
service to interact with.

## Scope and speed

A few flags control how much you scan and how fast:

- `-p-` scans all 65535 ports, `-F` scans the top 100, `-p1-1023` scans a range.
- `-T0` through `-T5` set timing, slowest to fastest. `-T4` is a reasonable default.
- `--min-rate` and `--max-rate` cap the packets per second.

Speed is a tradeoff. Fast scans finish sooner but are louder and more likely to trip
detection. Slow scans blend into normal traffic.

## Takeaway

Run `-sS` for TCP by default, fall back to `-sT` without root, and do not skip `-sU`.
The scan tells you what is open. What you do with an open port is the next room.
