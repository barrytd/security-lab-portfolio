# Nmap Advanced Port Scans - Stealth Scans and Evasion

The basic scans finish the handshake or half-open it. The advanced scans do something
different: they send TCP packets with flag combinations a normal connection never uses,
which lets them read a port's state from how a firewall reacts. The second half of the
room is about hiding the source of the scan.

## Flag-based scans

**Null (`-sN`)** sets no flags. **FIN (`-sF`)** sets only FIN. **Xmas (`-sX`)** sets
FIN, PSH, and URG, so the packet is lit up like a Christmas tree. All three rely on the
same rule: a closed port replies with RST, and an open port stays silent. So a lack of
reply means the port is open or filtered, and an RST means closed.

The catch is what kind of firewall sits in front. A stateless firewall only checks for
the SYN flag to spot a connection attempt, so these odd-flag packets walk past it. A
stateful firewall tracks connections and blocks anything that is not part of a valid
one, which makes these scans useless against it. That is the whole reason to know more
than one scan type.

## ACK and Window scans read the firewall

**ACK (`-sA`)** sends a packet with only ACK set. It cannot tell open from closed, but
it maps the firewall. A port that replies with RST is `unfiltered`, meaning the firewall
let the packet through. A port that stays silent is `filtered`. So the ACK scan answers
a different question: not "what is open," but "what does the firewall allow."

## Hiding the source

Spoofing your address only works when you can see the return traffic, so on its own it
is limited. The room covers a few ways to obscure the source anyway:

- `-S SPOOFED_IP` sends packets with a fake source IP.
- `--spoof-mac` fakes the MAC address.
- `-D DECOY1,DECOY2,ME` runs a decoy scan, mixing your real IP into a crowd of fake
  ones so the target cannot tell which is really scanning.
- `-sI ZOMBIE_IP` is the idle scan. It bounces the scan off an idle third host and reads
  that host's IP ID counter to infer the target's port states, so your address never
  touches the target.

## Packet-level tricks

`-f` fragments the packets into 8-byte pieces and `-ff` into 16-byte pieces, which can
slip probes past filters that inspect whole packets. `--source-port` makes traffic look
like it comes from a trusted port such as 53. `--data-length` pads packets to look less
like a scan.

## The one flag worth keeping

`--reason` prints why nmap reached each conclusion. An open port shows `syn-ack`,
because the target sent back a SYN/ACK. Seeing the evidence rather than the label is the
fastest way to actually understand what a scan is doing.

## Takeaway

Stealth scans are situational: they beat stateless firewalls and fall flat against
stateful ones. The value is knowing which scan fits which defense, and knowing that
spoofing, decoys, and the idle scan exist for when the source needs to stay hidden.
