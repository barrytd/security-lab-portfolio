# Nmap Post Port Scans - Service Detection, OS Detection, and NSE

A port scan tells you a port is open. This room is about the next step: figuring out
what is actually running there, what OS the host is, and pulling extra detail with
scripts. It closes out the Nmap series.

## Service and version detection

```bash
nmap -sV TARGET_IP                 # detect the service and version on each open port
nmap -sV --version-light TARGET_IP # fewer probes, faster, less certain
nmap -sV --version-all TARGET_IP   # every probe, slower, more thorough
```

The version string is the point. A service banner like `vsftpd 3.0.3` is what you match
against known vulnerabilities.

## OS detection and traceroute

```bash
nmap -O TARGET_IP            # fingerprint the operating system
nmap --traceroute TARGET_IP  # map the hops to the target
```

When nmap cannot find an exact OS match it prints the raw fingerprint. You can still
read the TTL from it: a `T=40` value is hex for 64, which points to Linux. Windows
starts at 128.

## Nmap Scripting Engine

NSE scripts live in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts` and extend nmap well past port scanning.

```bash
nmap -sC TARGET_IP                        # run the default safe scripts
nmap --script=http-robots.txt TARGET_IP   # run a specific script
nmap --script-help SCRIPTNAME             # read what a script does before running it
```

`--script-help` is worth the habit. It shows the description and category (safe,
intrusive, vuln) so you know what a script does before it touches a target. Vuln scripts
follow the pattern `http-vuln-cveYYYY-NNNN`, named after the CVE.

## The shortcut and saving output

```bash
nmap -A TARGET_IP            # -sV, -O, -sC, and --traceroute in one command
nmap -oN out.txt TARGET_IP   # normal output to a file
nmap -oG out.gnmap TARGET_IP # greppable output
nmap -oX out.xml TARGET_IP   # XML output, parseable by other tools
nmap -oA out TARGET_IP       # all three formats at once
```

## Takeaway

`-sV` and `-sC` are the two you will run most. `-A` bundles the full workup when you
want everything, and `-oA` saves it in every format so you have a record to work from.
That finishes the Nmap module: discovery, basic scans, advanced scans, and now the
post-scan detail.
